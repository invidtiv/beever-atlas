"""Shared channel-discovery logic used by both the dashboard `/api/channels`
endpoint and the MCP/orchestration `list_channels` capability.

Previously this lived inside ``src/beever_atlas/api/channels.py`` as private
helpers (``_make_bridge_adapter``, ``_fetch_connection_channels``,
``_fetch_file_connection_channels``). The `list_channels` capability used
to return only ``conn.selected_channels``, which hid all non-file
connections whose sync pick-list was empty — even though the dashboard
sidebar showed them. Extracting the dashboard's discovery logic here
and having both callers use it is the single source of truth.

Behavioural notes:

- For ``platform == "file"`` connections, ``selected_channels`` IS the
  canonical list (file uploads don't have a bridge to query). Names are
  pulled from the activity log. ``is_member_only`` has no effect here
  since file channels are always "connected" in the synthesised sense.
- For all other platforms, the bridge adapter's ``list_channels()`` is
  called to get every available channel; ``selected_channels`` is then
  applied as a filter ONLY when it is non-empty (it is a sync pick-list,
  not an access ACL — see commit ba615c1).
- ``is_member_only`` (default ``False``): when ``True`` AND
  ``selected_channels`` is empty, only channels where the bot is an
  actual member (``ChannelInfo.is_member is True``) are returned. This
  matches what the dashboard's Channels page considers "CONNECTED" and is
  what the MCP/orchestration path wants so the QA agent can only surface
  channels it can actually read messages from. When ``selected_channels``
  is non-empty the user's explicit pick-list wins and the membership
  filter is skipped (the user opted in explicitly). The dashboard route
  keeps passing ``is_member_only=False`` because its UI needs both
  connected and available channels.
- A short-lived in-memory cache per ``connection_id`` prevents repeated
  bridge calls on rapid polling. The cache stores the raw bridge list so
  both filtered and unfiltered callers benefit; filters are applied after
  the cache read.
