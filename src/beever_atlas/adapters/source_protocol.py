"""Source protocols for the Message Store.

Defines the seam between content sources and the durable
``channel_messages`` collection introduced in PR-A.1. Two structurally-typed
protocols cover the two ingestion shapes:

* :class:`PullSource` — cursor-based, called by the sync runner. Existing
  platform adapters (Slack / Discord / Teams / etc.) are wrapped to satisfy
  this protocol.
* :class:`PushSource` — webhook-driven, called by an external system that
  pushes events. The OpenClaw / Hermes push-ingest endpoint (PR-D)
  registers as a ``PushSource``.

Both write to the Message Store; neither owns LLM extraction (that's the
worker's job, PR-B). The split keeps interface segregation honest — a
``PullSource`` does not implement ``on_message_received``, and a
``PushSource`` does not implement ``fetch_and_persist``.

Spec:
``openspec/changes/oss-pipeline-and-wiki-redesign/specs/message-source-protocol/``.
