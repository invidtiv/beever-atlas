"""Content validators for LLM-generated wiki sections.

Each validator is a callable ``(content: str) -> tuple[bool, str]`` that returns
``(ok, reason)``. ``reason`` is empty when ``ok`` is True; otherwise a short,
prompt-ready hint that `_call_llm` appends to the next retry prompt.

Validators are intentionally permissive: they flag clearly-broken output
(missing headings, unbalanced fences, filler-heavy prose) without over-fitting.
