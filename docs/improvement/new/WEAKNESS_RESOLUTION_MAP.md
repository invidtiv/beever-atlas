## Detailed Resolution Per Weakness

### 1.1 Top-Down Only Retrieval (No Bottom-Up)

**Original Problem:** `retrieve()` only expands downward. If Tier 2 atomic search returns weak results, there's no way to navigate up to Tier 1 clusters for broader context. If Tier 0 summary is stale, there's no way to synthesize from fresh Tier 2 data.

**v2 Resolution: Bidirectional Expansion**

The improved Semantic Retriever adds upward expansion to every depth:

```python
# In SemanticRetriever.retrieve():

# Topic depth: after searching clusters + scoped atomics
if self._should_expand(memories, "up"):
    summaries = await self._retrieve_summary(channel_id, query)
    memories = self._merge_and_rerank(memories, summaries)

# Detail depth: after searching atomics directly
if self._should_expand(memories, "up"):
    clusters = await self._retrieve_clusters(channel_id, query)
    memories = self._merge_and_rerank(memories, clusters)
```

**Additionally**, the Graph Memory provides a complementary upward path. When semantic search at Tier 2 is weak, the router can fall back to Neo4j entity traversal — effectively navigating "up" via relationship structure rather than text hierarchy.

**Proposal section:** §3.2 (Semantic Memory, `ImprovedSemanticRetriever`)

---

### 1.2 Hardcoded Expansion Thresholds Are Meaningless

**Original Problem:** `if len(memories) < 2` and `if len(memories) < 3` — raw counts, not relevance scores. 5 irrelevant results = "enough"; 1 perfect result = "expand."

**v2 Resolution: Score-Based Expansion**

```python
def _should_expand(self, memories: list, direction: str) -> bool:
    """Score-based, not count-based."""
    if not memories:
        return True
    scores = [m.get("score", 0) for m in memories]
    return max(scores) < 0.6 or (sum(scores) / len(scores)) < 0.4
```

Both thresholds are configurable via `settings.expansion_score_threshold` and `settings.expansion_avg_threshold`.

After expansion, results are **re-ranked by score** (not just appended):
```python
memories = self._merge_and_rerank(original, expanded)
# Sorts by score descending, takes top max_results
```

**Proposal section:** §3.2 (`_should_expand` method)

---

### 1.3 Detail Queries Don't Benefit from Hierarchical Structure

**Original Problem:** Detail queries go straight to flat Tier 2 search across ALL atomic memories. For a channel with 10K memories, the hierarchy provides zero benefit — it's identical to flat vector search.

**v2 Resolution: Two-Stage Topic-First Retrieval (Solution A)**

Even for detail queries, the Semantic Retriever now uses topic clusters to scope the search:

```
Step 1 (coarse): Find relevant topic clusters
  hybrid_search(tier="tier1_cluster", topic_filter=extracted_topics)
  → "authentication" cluster (member_ids: [uuid1..uuid15])
  → "security" cluster (member_ids: [uuid20..uuid28])

Step 2 (fine): Search atomics WITHIN matched clusters only
  hybrid_search(tier="tier2_atomic", id_filter=member_ids)
  → Searches 43 memories instead of 10,000
```

**Prerequisites (from Solution A) are addressed:**
1. `_link_memories_to_cluster()` actually writes `cluster_id` → **FIXED** (see 1.11)
2. `cluster_id` filter in `hybrid_search()` → **ADDED** as `id_filter` parameter

**Fallback:** If no matching clusters are found (new topic not yet clustered), falls back to global Tier 2 search — same as v1 behavior, so no regression.

**Proposal section:** §3.2 (`depth == "topic"` branch)

---

### 1.4 Temporal Decay Exists But Is Never Applied

**Original Problem:** `apply_temporal_decay()` exists in `temporal.py:153-181` but is never called. Only `enrich_memories_with_temporal()` (text labels) is used. A 6-month-old fact has identical retrieval weight as yesterday's.

**v2 Resolution: Temporal Decay Wired Into Retrieval**

```python
# In SemanticRetriever.retrieve(), BEFORE returning results:
self._apply_temporal_decay(memories)

def _apply_temporal_decay(self, memories: list) -> None:
    for m in memories:
        days_ago = self._days_since(m.get("timestamp"))
        decay = math.exp(-self.decay_rate * (days_ago / 30))
        m["score"] *= decay
    memories.sort(key=lambda m: m.get("score", 0), reverse=True)
```

Additionally, the Graph Memory provides **bi-temporal tracking** on all relationships:
- `valid_from`: when the relationship became true
- `valid_until`: when it was invalidated (null = current)
- `created_at`: when we ingested it

This means the temporal query "How did auth evolve?" follows `SUPERSEDES` chains in Neo4j with proper time ordering — something the v1 text labels could never support.

**Proposal section:** §3.2 (`_apply_temporal_decay`), §3.3 (temporal properties on Neo4j relationships)

---

### 1.5 No Feedback Loop for Retrieval Quality

**Original Problem:** No thumbs up/down, no citation tracking, no active learning. The eval plan (`09-MEMORY_EVAL_PLAN.md`) is documentation only — no pipeline runs in production.

**v2 Resolution: Citation Tracking + Quality Metrics**

The v2 Weaviate schema includes `quality_score` on every atomic memory. The response generator tracks which memories were actually cited:

```python
# In response_generator.py:
async def generate(self, query, memories, ...) -> Response:
    response = await self._llm_generate(query, memories)

    # Track which memories were cited
    cited_ids = self._extract_cited_memory_ids(response)

    # Log to MongoDB for quality analysis
    await self.mongo.quality_logs.insert_one({
        "query": query,
        "retrieved_ids": [m["id"] for m in memories],
        "cited_ids": cited_ids,
        "retrieval_precision": len(cited_ids) / len(memories),
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow(),
    })
```

This enables:
- **Precision@K tracking**: What % of retrieved memories were actually useful?
- **Citation coverage**: Are we finding the right information?
- **Future active learning**: Boost memories that get cited, penalize those that don't

**Status:** Partially addressed in v2 (tracking infrastructure). Full active learning loop is Phase 2+.

**Proposal section:** §3.2 (Weaviate schema: `quality_score`), §9 (module structure: `mongo_store.py`)

---

### 1.6 Single Workspace, Slack Only

**Original Problem:** Hardcoded to single Slack workspace. No Teams, Discord, or multi-workspace support.

**v2 Resolution: Python Adapter Layer with NormalizedMessage**

```python
class NormalizedMessage:
    content: str
    author: AuthorInfo
    platform: Platform          # slack | teams | discord
    channel_id: str
    channel_name: str
    message_id: str
    timestamp: datetime
    thread_id: str | None
    attachments: list[Attachment]
    ...

class SlackAdapter(BaseAdapter):   # slack-sdk (Python)
class TeamsAdapter(BaseAdapter):   # Microsoft Graph API
class DiscordAdapter(BaseAdapter): # discord.py
```

Every adapter normalizes platform-specific messages into `NormalizedMessage`. The rest of the pipeline is platform-agnostic.

**Chat SDK evaluation:** The [Vercel Chat SDK](https://chat-sdk.dev/) is TypeScript-only and can't fetch message history. It's suitable for real-time webhooks (Phase 2) but not batch ingestion. Python adapters are the primary ingestion mechanism.

**Proposal section:** §5.1 (Multi-Platform Adapters)

---

### 1.7 No Real-Time Sync

**Original Problem:** Sync is pull-based only. `slack_app_token` and `slack_signing_secret` config fields exist but are unused. Socket Mode was planned but never implemented.

**v2 Resolution: Dual-Mode Ingestion**

- **Mode 1 (primary):** Python adapters for batch history fetch — works today, no webhook infrastructure needed
- **Mode 2 (Phase 2):** Optional Chat SDK TypeScript bridge for real-time webhook ingestion

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml — Phase 2 addition:
chat-sdk-bridge:
  build: ./chat-sdk-bridge
  environment:
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: ${SLACK_BOT_TOKEN}
    BEEVER_API_URL: http://beever-atlas:8000
```

The Chat SDK bridge receives webhook events from Slack/Teams/Discord and POSTs normalized messages to the Python backend's `/api/ingest` endpoint.

**Status:** Batch sync is the v2 MVP. Real-time is Phase 2.

**Proposal section:** §5.1 (Chat SDK evaluation, dual-mode diagram)

---

### 1.8 No Memory Expiration / Storage Growth Management

**Original Problem:** No automated TTL, no archival, no pruning. Channels accumulate unbounded memories.

**v2 Resolution: Ebbinghaus Decay + Bi-Temporal Model**

Two complementary mechanisms:

**1. Retrieval-time decay (Ebbinghaus):** Old memories naturally rank lower via `apply_temporal_decay()`. They still exist but don't surface in results unless reinforced (frequently cited/accessed).

**2. Bi-temporal `valid_at`/`invalid_at`:** When a fact is superseded (detected via Neo4j `SUPERSEDES` edges), the old Weaviate memory gets `invalid_at` set. Queries can filter out invalidated facts:

```python
# In hybrid_search, optionally exclude invalidated memories:
if exclude_invalidated:
    combined_filter &= Filter.by_property("invalid_at").is_none(True)
```

**3. Future: Scheduled pruning** (Phase 2+): Archive memories where `quality_score < 0.3` AND `days_ago > 90` AND `never_cited = True`.

**Proposal section:** §3.2 (temporal decay), §3.3 (bi-temporal properties), §3.4 (SUPERSEDES edges)

---

### 1.9 ADK Migration Incomplete

**Original Problem:** The `agents/` directory has ADK scaffolding (coordinator, orchestrator, retrieval agents) but they're disconnected from the main MCP tools path in `server.py`.

**v2 Resolution: Clean Architecture, No Partial ADK**

The v2 redesign has a clean module structure with no leftover scaffolding:

```
src/beever_atlas/
├── retrieval/
│   ├── query_router.py          # Replaces regex classifier + ADK orchestrator
│   ├── semantic_retriever.py    # Replaces hierarchical_retrieval.py
│   ├── graph_retriever.py       # NEW — Neo4j traversal
│   └── response_generator.py   # Replaces grounding.py
```

The query router handles what the ADK coordinator/orchestrator was supposed to do — route queries to the right retrieval system — but without the incomplete ADK agent framework. If ADK is needed later, it can be integrated cleanly into the router.

**Proposal section:** §9 (Module Structure)

---

### 1.10 Query Classification Uses Brittle Regex

**Original Problem:** `QueryClassifier` uses hardcoded regex. `(\w+)` captures only single-word topics. DETAIL patterns checked first cause misclassification. `model_query_classification = gemini-2.5-flash-lite` is configured but never used.

**v2 Resolution: LLM-Powered Query Understanding (Enhanced Solution E)**

The v2 query router goes beyond Solution E's original proposal. Instead of just classifying overview/topic/detail, it also:
- **Routes to Semantic vs Graph memory** (new capability from dual-memory architecture)
- **Extracts entities** for Neo4j fuzzy matching (not just topics)
- **Detects temporal intent** (recent/any/historical)
- **Falls back to regex** for obvious queries (zero cost fast path)

```python
QUERY_UNDERSTANDING_PROMPT = """
Classify this query:
1. route: "semantic" | "graph" | "both"
2. semantic_depth: "overview" | "topic" | "detail"
3. entities: ["Alice", "JWT"]
4. topics: ["authentication", "deployment"]   ← multi-word, multi-topic
5. temporal_scope: "recent" | "any" | "historical"
6. confidence: 0.0-1.0
"""
```

**Key improvements over Solution E:**
- Multi-word topics: "API design" instead of just "API" ✓
- Multi-topic detection: "NBA and FIFA" → `["NBA", "FIFA"]` ✓
- No priority misclassification: LLM understands intent holistically ✓
- Additionally: routes to graph memory for relational queries (Solution E didn't have this)

**Cost:** Same ~$0.001/query using `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` — the model that was already configured but unused.

**Proposal section:** §4.1 (Query Understanding), §4.2 (Routing Strategy)

---

### 1.11 Cluster Linking Is a No-Op (THE Blocker)

**Original Problem:** `_link_memories_to_cluster()` is literally a `logger.debug()` — it never writes `cluster_id` to atomic memories. This breaks everything: topic-first retrieval is impossible, consolidation re-processes the same memories every run, duplicate clusters accumulate.

**v2 Resolution: Actually Write `cluster_id`**

```python
async def _link_memories_to_cluster(self, memories, cluster_id):
    """v1: no-op. v2: ACTUALLY writes cluster_id."""
    collection = self.weaviate.collections.get(COLLECTION_NAME)
    for memory in memories:
        if memory.get("id"):
            collection.data.update(
                uuid=memory["id"],
                properties={"cluster_id": cluster_id}
            )
    logger.info(f"Linked {len(memories)} memories to cluster {cluster_id}")
```

**Additionally, prevent duplicate clusters:**
```python
async def _consolidate_to_clusters(self, channel_id):
    for topic, memories in topic_groups.items():
        # CHECK if cluster already exists for this topic
        existing = await self._find_existing_cluster(channel_id, topic)
        if existing:
            await self._update_cluster(existing, memories)  # Update, don't duplicate
        else:
            cluster_id = await self._create_topic_cluster(channel_id, topic, memories)

        # THIS LINE ACTUALLY WORKS NOW
        await self._link_memories_to_cluster(memories, cluster_id)
```

This unblocks:
- ✅ Topic-first retrieval (Solution A)
- ✅ `_get_unclustered_memories()` correctly filters already-clustered memories
- ✅ No more duplicate cluster accumulation

**Proposal section:** §3.2 (Consolidation Service)

---

### 1.12 No Cross-Channel Search

**Original Problem:** Every query tool requires `channel_id`. If auth was discussed in `#backend` but user asks in `#frontend`, it won't be found.

**v2 Resolution: Graph Memory Naturally Spans Channels**

In the Semantic Memory (Weaviate), queries remain channel-scoped — this is by design for cost and relevance.

But the Graph Memory (Neo4j) naturally provides cross-channel visibility because **entities span channels**:

```cypher
-- "What decisions has Alice made?" — searches across ALL channels
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Alice"})-[:DECIDED]->(d:Decision)
RETURN d.summary, d.channel, d.valid_from
ORDER BY d.valid_from DESC
```

A `Person(Alice)` node created from `#backend` messages is the SAME node referenced in `#frontend` messages. The graph naturally deduplicates entities across channels.

**Status:** Graph-based cross-channel queries work by default. Weaviate cross-channel search is deferred (lower priority, per your notes).

**Proposal section:** §3.3 (Graph Memory), §3.4 (Memory Interconnection)

---

### 1.13 Memory Quality Is Low (5.25/10)

**Original Problem:** 319-memory audit: 5.25/10 average quality, 2.44 facts per message (too many), only 2.2% high quality, 17% vague/generic. Examples: "The user does not use 'uv'", "The output was adjusted accordingly."

**v2 Resolution: Quality Gate at Extraction (Solution F, Enhanced)**

Three layers of quality control:

**Layer 1: Extraction prompt improvement**
```
Extract only the MOST IMPORTANT 1-2 facts from this message.
Each fact MUST be self-contained — understandable without the original message.
Do NOT extract obvious, trivial, or context-dependent statements.
```
Target: 1-2 facts/message (down from 2.44)

**Layer 2: Quality gate scoring + rejection**
```python
class MemoryQualityGate:
    MIN_QUALITY_SCORE = 0.5
    MAX_FACTS_PER_MESSAGE = 2
    VAGUE_PATTERNS = ["the user", "the process", "it was", ...]

    def score_fact(self, fact):
        # Length, vagueness, specificity, self-containedness checks
        # Returns 0.0-1.0

    def gate(self, facts):
        # Reject < 0.5, keep top 2 by quality
```
Target: reject vague/generic → < 5% (down from 17%)

**Layer 3: Retrieval-time quality boost**
```python
# Quality-weighted ranking: good memories score higher
quality = mem.get("quality_score", 0.5)
mem["score"] = mem["score"] * (0.7 + 0.3 * quality)
```

**Expected impact:** Quality score from 5.25/10 → target > 7.0/10. High quality (>6) from 2.2% → target > 50%.

**Proposal section:** §5.4 (Quality Gate)

---

### 1.14 No Per-Query-Type Hybrid Alpha Tuning

**Original Problem:** `get_adaptive_alpha()` exists in `weaviate_client.py` but is bypassed by hierarchical retrieval because it always passes an explicit `alpha` (hardcoded `0.3` for Tier 0, `settings.hybrid_alpha` for Tier 1/2).

**v2 Resolution: Pass `alpha=None` (Solution G)**

One-line fix per retrieval method:

```python
# Before (v1):
await hybrid_search(..., alpha=settings.hybrid_alpha)

# After (v2):
await hybrid_search(..., alpha=None)  # → get_adaptive_alpha() runs automatically
```

The existing `get_adaptive_alpha()` logic is sound:
- Short keyword queries → favor BM25 (`alpha=0.2`)
- Medium queries → balanced (`alpha=0.5`)
- Long semantic queries → favor vector (`alpha=0.7`)

This is applied in ALL three retrieval methods: `_retrieve_summary`, `_retrieve_clusters`, `_retrieve_atomics`.

**Proposal section:** §3.2 (all retrieval calls use `alpha=None`)

---

### 1.15 No Semantic Deduplication Across Tiers

**Original Problem:** Dedup only checks by memory ID. Same information in Tier 1 cluster summary and Tier 2 atomic gets included twice, wasting LLM token budget.

**v2 Resolution: Jaccard Similarity Dedup (Solution H)**

Applied after tier expansion merges results:

```python
def _semantic_dedup(self, memories: list, threshold=0.85) -> list:
    unique = []
    for mem in memories:
        is_dup = any(
            self._jaccard_similarity(mem["memory"], e["memory"]) > threshold
            for e in unique
        )
        if not is_dup:
            unique.append(mem)
    return unique
```

When a Tier 1 summary and Tier 2 atomic overlap semantically, the **more specific one** (typically the atomic with citations) is kept.

**Proposal section:** §3.2 (`_semantic_dedup` method)

---

## What the Graph Memory Adds (Beyond v1 Weaknesses)

The original `RETRIEVAL_IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md` focused on fixing the existing Weaviate-only system. The v2 proposal goes further by adding Graph Memory (Neo4j), which addresses limitations that weren't explicitly listed as weaknesses but are inherent to a vector-only architecture:

| Limitation (implicit in v1) | Graph Memory Solution |
|---|---|
| Can't answer "Who decided X?" | Person → DECIDED → Decision traversal |
| Can't answer "What blocks project Y?" | Project ← BLOCKED_BY ← Constraint traversal |
| Can't track fact evolution over time | Decision → SUPERSEDES → older Decision chains |
| Can't connect entities across channels | Same Person node referenced from multiple channels |
| Can't show organizational structure | Person → MEMBER_OF → Team → OWNS → Project |
| Can't detect contradictions | Bi-temporal `valid_until` on superseded relationships |
| No relationship context in wiki | Wiki "People" and "Decisions" sections from Neo4j |

These are capabilities that **no amount of Weaviate improvement can provide** — they require a graph data model.

---

## Completeness Check

| Original Weakness | Has v2 Fix? | Fix Quality |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 Top-down only | ✅ | Full — bidirectional expansion + graph fallback |
| 1.2 Count thresholds | ✅ | Full — score-based, configurable |
| 1.3 Detail bypasses hierarchy | ✅ | Full — topic-first two-stage retrieval |
| 1.4 Temporal decay unused | ✅ | Full — wired into pipeline + bi-temporal graph |
| 1.5 No feedback loop | ⚠️ Partial | Tracking infra in v2; active learning in Phase 2+ |
| 1.6 Slack only | ✅ | Full — adapter layer with NormalizedMessage |
| 1.7 No real-time sync | ⚠️ Partial | Batch in v2 MVP; Chat SDK real-time in Phase 2 |
| 1.8 No memory expiration | ⚠️ Partial | Ebbinghaus decay + bi-temporal invalidation; pruning in Phase 2 |
| 1.9 ADK incomplete | ✅ | Full — clean architecture, no leftover scaffolding |
| 1.10 Regex classifier | ✅ | Full — LLM query understanding with graph routing |
| 1.11 Cluster linking no-op | ✅ | Full — actually writes cluster_id + dedup clusters |
| 1.12 No cross-channel | ⚠️ Partial | Graph entities span channels; Weaviate cross-channel deferred |
| 1.13 Quality 5.25/10 | ✅ | Full — 3-layer quality gate (prompt + scoring + retrieval boost) |
| 1.14 No adaptive alpha | ✅ | Full — `alpha=None` in all methods |
| 1.15 No semantic dedup | ✅ | Full — Jaccard similarity after tier expansion |

**Result:** 11/15 fully resolved, 4/15 partially resolved (with clear Phase 2 plans).
